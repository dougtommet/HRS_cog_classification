## Analysis notes 

**Covariate centering.** Sociodemographics are centered at age 70, education grade 12, and the complex survey-weighted means in the HRS/HCAP 2016 age 65+ subsample (n = 3,496) for Black or African-American vs all other race and ethnicity groups, Hispanic vs not-Hispanic, and female sex. 

**Sample restriction.** Analyses, tables, and figures will be explicitly limited to the appropriate target sample (e.g., n = 9763, n = 3496, n = 50).
