# Age splines
# I use the same rule for RCS definition for age splines as was used in the HCAP analyses.
# It is important that this RCS definition:
#   1. Be included in a function for application to future data sets
#   2. Not rely upon sample (current data set) distributions of age
#
# Here are notes from ../HCAP23/POSTED/ANALYSIS/Integrated_Analysis/041-Normalization-Standardization.do
# 3. Regression adjustment
#    Regress each Blom-transformed factor score (separately) on age, sex,
#    race, Hispanic ethnicity, and educational attainment.
#
#    Age is modeled as a continuous predictor using restricted cubic
#    splines with knots at 70, 78, 86, 94 (on a range of 65-103). These
#    knots were chosen ad hoc using an empirical process, and fall at
#    the 25th, 60th, 88th, and 99th percentiles of \verb+hcapage+.
#
#    The somewhat unusual choice of knot locations is driven by the
#    cross-sectional relationship between age and cognitive test score.
#    The shape is distinctly hockey-stick-shaped relationship where a
#    nearly linear performance-age relationship is seen through most of
#    the age range (older people performing worse) but then the direction
#    shifts and older people perform better.
#
#    This effect is likely caused by the retention of only the most
#    cognitively-intact persons among the oldest-old following our
#    exclusions from the norming sample. The knot choice is meant to get
#    more parameters estimated in the region where the age-performance
#    relationship is more dynamic.
#
#    Sex is modeled as male and female using a dummy variable
#
#    Race and ethnicity are coarsely modeled with two dummy variables,
#    one indicating Black or African-American, the other Hispanic ethnicty.
#
#    Education is included as a continuous predcitor (0-17).
#
#           Note: we compared different ways for controlling for education
#              - A continuous variable (0-17)
#              - A categorical predictor identifying the following
#                groups defined in terms of years of completed schooling:
#                    0, 1-8, 9-11, 12, 13-15, 16, 17 and higher
#              - A restricted cubic spline with 4 knots placed at default
#                locations
#              - A set of models including two linear splines with knots
#                placed from 4 to 15 years
#
#              To evaluate these alternative parameterizations, we
#              regressed the estimated GCP (EAP), GCP (PV), MEM (EAP),
#              LFL (EAP), vdori1, vdvis1, h1rmseotal on each of the above
#              representations of education. For all except vdori1 and
#              h1rmseotal the model with the lowest BIC was the continuous
#              linear function of number of years of education.
#              Orientation favored two linear splines with a knot at 13
#              years of education, and the MMSE (h1rmsetotal) preferred the
#              restricted cubic splines.
#
#              Based on the predominance of evidence, we decided to keep
#              education as a continuous predictor.
#
#    Main effects and two-way interactions} are included. The only
#    two-way interaction that is not included is black*hisp, because
#    in sample there are no persons both Black and Hispanic.
