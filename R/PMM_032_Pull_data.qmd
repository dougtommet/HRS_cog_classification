# Compiling data 

Most of the data processing was handled in a previous workflow, and not documented here.

Please refer to `PMM_031_Pull_data.R`

Here are the contents of the working data file

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: asis

# Read the RDS file
PMM_31 <- readRDS(here::here("R_objects", "PMM_031.RDS"))

# Create table of variable names and labels
var_table <- tibble::tibble(
  variable = names(PMM_31),
  label = purrr::map_chr(PMM_31, ~ attr(.x, "label") %||% "")
)

# Show as HTML table
knitr::kable(var_table, format = "html", caption = "Variables and Labels in PMM_31")
```
