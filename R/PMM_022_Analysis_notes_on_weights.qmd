### Notes on weights: filters, subpopulation, weighted subpopulation

In complex survey data like HRS, filtering the dataset to a subpopulation (e.g., age 65+) and running an analysis as if this subset were a simple random sample leads to incorrect standard errors and potentially biased estimates. The correct approach is to use a *subpopulation analysis*, where the full design (weights, strata, clusters) is preserved, but the analysis is restricted to the subpopulation.

#### Key Points:

- In R (`survey` package): create a full `svydesign()` object using the full dataset, then apply `subset()` to restrict the analysis to the subpopulation.
- In Mplus: use the `SUBPOPULATION =` command, which allows you to include everyone in the data but restrict the estimation to a group (e.g., age â‰¥ 65) without dropping observations.
- Subpopulation routines ensure correct standard errors by preserving information about the full sample design.

#### Subpopulation Analysis in R Using the `survey` Package

The `survey` package in R provides full support for subpopulation analysis in complex survey data. The recommended approach is:

```
library(survey)

# Define the full survey design
hrs_design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~psuvar,
  strata = ~stratavar,
  weights = ~weightvar,
  data = hrs_full,
  nest = TRUE
)

# Restrict analysis to a subpopulation (e.g., age 65+)
h65_design <- subset(hrs_design, age >= 65)

# Example analysis
svymean(~cog_score, design = h65_design)
```

This approach preserves the full information about the sample design, even though the estimation is limited to the subset. It avoids the bias introduced by dropping non-subpopulation cases from the dataset.

#### Why Not Just Filter the Data?

If you were to do:

```
subset_data <- hrs_full %>% filter(age >= 65)
subset_design <- svydesign(ids = ~psuvar, strata = ~stratavar, weights = ~weightvar, data = subset_data)
```

You would be telling R that the `subset_data` sample is a full probability sample, when in fact it is a subpopulation from a larger design. This would underestimate standard errors and potentially bias point estimates.

#### Notes on Variance Estimation

- Functions like `svymean()` and `svyglm()` will automatically compute standard errors correctly for subpopulations if `subset()` is used.
- Use `svyby()` for multiple subgroups.

This logic is conceptually the same as the `SUBPOPULATION =` feature in Mplus.

```
svyby(~cog_score, ~sex, h65_design, svymean)
```
