THE BEST LOGLIKELIHOOD VALUE HAS BEEN REPLICATED.  RERUN WITH AT LEAST TWICE THE
RANDOM STARTS TO CHECK THAT THE BEST LOGLIKELIHOOD IS STILL OBTAINED AND REPLICATED.

     ONE OR MORE PARAMETERS WERE FIXED TO AVOID SINGULARITY OF THE
     INFORMATION MATRIX. THE SINGULARITY IS MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THE
     MODEL IS NOT IDENTIFIED, OR BECAUSE OF EMPTY CELLS IN THE JOINT
     DISTRIBUTION OF THE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES IN THE MODEL.
     THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS WERE FIXED:
     Parameter 39, %CG#1%: [ VDCOUNT$1 ] (equality/label)
